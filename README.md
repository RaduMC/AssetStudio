**AssetStudio** is an independent tool for exploring, extracting and exporting assets.

**None of the repo, the tool, nor the repo owner is affiliated with, or sponsored or authorized by, Unity Technologies or its affiliates.**

**This project is no longer maintained. Thank you all for your feedback and testing.**

It is the continuation of my Importer script for 3ds Max, and comprises all my research and reverse engineering file formats. It has been thoroughly tested with builds from most platforms, ranging from Web, PC, Linux, MacOS to Xbox360, PS3, Android and iOS.
This project is no longer maintained and is probably not compatible with recent builds.

#### Current features

* Export to FBX, with complete hierarchy, transformations, materials and textures. Geometry is exported with normals, tangents, UV coordinates, vertex colors and deformers. Skeleton nodes can be exported either as bones or dummy deformers
* Extraction of assets that can be used as standalone resources:
  * Textures: DDS (Alpha8bpp, ARGB16bpp, RGB24bpp, ARGB32bpp, BGRA32bpp, RGB565, DXT1, DXT5, RGBA16bpp)
  * PVR (PVRTC_RGB2, PVRTC_RGBA2, PVRTC_RGBA4, PVRTC_RGB4, ETC_RGB4)
  * Audio clips: mp3, ogg, wav, xbox wav (including streams from .resS files)
  * Fonts: ttf, otf
  * Text Assets
  * Shaders
* Real-time preview window for the above-mentioned assets
